# The influence of query order on teaching ability and preference-based learning with a pepper robot in a social greeting setting

In this project, we aim to see the effects of query order on the teaching ability of human participants and on the mean squared error of data trained by the stable baselines 3 PPO package and with a reward function from APReL. The experiment is set as a social greeting interaction of two greetings, a handshake and a high five. To run the record_traj, natural_rec, pose_tester, Practice_loose, run_Aprel_handshake and run_Aprel_high_five a physical pepper robot is needed.
