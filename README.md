# An experimental study on the influence of query order on robot preference-based learning for human-robot social greeting.

In this project, we aim to see the effects of query order on the teaching ability of human participants and on the mean squared error of data trained by the stable baselines 3 PPO package and with a reward function from APReL. The experiment is set as a social greeting interaction of two greetings, a handshake and a high five. To run the record_traj, natural_rec, pose_tester, Practice_loose, run_Aprel_handshake and run_Aprel_high_five a physical pepper robot is needed.

# Project Structure
/code: This directory contains the source code for the implementation of the preference-based learning (PBL) algorithm used in the project. The code is written in Python and implements the Adaptive Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (APReL) method.
/data: The data directory includes sample datasets used for training and evaluating the robot's social skills. It also provides instructions on how to obtain additional datasets.
/results: This directory contains the output files and analysis results generated during the experimental evaluation of the PBL algorithm. It includes performance metrics and statistical analysis.
